## About the Project

This project visualizes earthquake data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Using this interactive map, users can explore recent earthquake occurrences worldwide with markers that vary in size and color according to earthquake magnitude and depth. This tool helps to convey the intensity and location of seismic events to the general public and other stakeholders.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a clear and accessible tool that allows users to:

- View earthquakes from the last seven days on an interactive map.
- Quickly interpret earthquake magnitude by marker size and earthquake depth by color.
- Access detailed information about each earthquake, including magnitude, location, depth, and time of occurrence.

The USGS can leverage this map to educate the public on earthquake activity, share insights with other agencies, and enhance its funding opportunities by demonstrating the significance of its data collection.

## Technology Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the web page, including the map container.
- **JavaScript (Leaflet and D3)**: Powers the map's interactive features. Leaflet is used for mapping and markers, while D3 handles data loading and processing.
- **CSS**: Styles the map container and page layout to enhance user experience.
- **Leaflet Library**: Facilitates interactive map creation, including zooming, panning, and layering of earthquake markers based on magnitude and depth.

## Earthquake Data Visualization

- **Marker Size**: Reflects earthquake magnitude; larger markers indicate stronger earthquakes.
- **Marker Color**: Indicates earthquake depth; deeper earthquakes appear in darker colors.
- **Legend**: A color-coded legend provides depth ranges, helping users quickly interpret the data.
- **Popups**: Each marker displays additional earthquake details on click, including magnitude, depth, and location.
